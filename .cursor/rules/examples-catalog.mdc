# Catalog Requirements
- Home = searchable **list of component names**; tap → detail with **live knobs** (Toggles/Sliders/Pickers/TextFields) to tweak props.
- Provide **presets** (Default, Dense, High-Contrast, Large Type) + a **Reset** action.
- Show the **Swift snippet** for the current configuration with “Copy”.
- Include quick **a11y toggles** (Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, High Contrast, Reduce Motion).
- Demonstrate **iOS 26** features with clear labels; show fallbacks where applicable.

# Architecture Notes
- The Demo App depends on the package via **local SPM** (no code duplication).
- Maintain a simple **registry** of components for the list; avoid runtime reflection.
- **No network/telemetry**. No secrets. Deterministic previews (sizes/seeds) for snapshots.

# Include (helpers)
@catalog-registry.swift
@knobs-panel.swift
@deeplink-router.swift
